If you run Illumio PCE, you've probably hit the wall: the platform does segmentation well, but every org has five more things they need on top of it — firewall rule exports, time-based policy scheduling, ZTNA sync, or a way to manage policy as code across multiple teams.

I've been building Plugger, an open-source plugin framework that extends PCE without touching your production config. Each plugin runs as a Docker container. One command to install, one to start everything.

A few things worth calling out:

**Policy Resolver** — translates label-based policy into IP-level firewall rules. Export as Palo Alto CLI, Cisco ACL, or iptables commands. Your network team gets copy-paste ready rules for path firewalls. Handles allow, deny, and override-deny with proper ordering.

**Rule Scheduler** — time-based policy automation. Business hours access Mon-Fri 09:00-17:00, maintenance windows Saturday 02:00-06:00, weekend lockdowns. YAML config, immediate reconciliation, auto-provision.

**ZTNA Sync** — syncs Illumio workloads to Zscaler ZPA, Netskope, Cloudflare Access, or Cisco Secure Access as application definitions. Labels → ZTNA app segments with IPs and ports. Analytics mode to preview, sync mode to push.

**Policy GitOps** — policy-as-code with Git. CODEOWNERS enforces multi-team review for cross-scope rules. Security pipeline checks for any-to-any, insecure protocols. Traffic evidence proves each rule is needed. Provision on merge.

20 plugins total, covering monitoring, AI analysis, integrations (Palo Alto, Infoblox, ZTNA, CMDB), and operations. Templates in Go, Python, Shell, and JavaScript.

Want to build your own? There's a built-in Claude Code skill — point Claude at your plugger repo, describe what you need, and it scaffolds the full plugin with PCE connectivity, dashboard, and Docker container. From idea to running plugin in minutes.

Open source, community-driven. Would love to hear what you'd want to see next.
