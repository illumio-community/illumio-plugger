## The Problem

Illumio PCE handles segmentation well. But every deployment generates a list of adjacent requirements: export policy as firewall rules, quarantine a compromised workload from an EDR alert, generate a posture score for auditors, keep CMDB attributes in sync with labels, analyze which applications break if a shared service goes down.

Building these as standalone scripts works once. It doesn't scale — credentials scattered across hosts, no restart logic, no observability, no upgrade path.

---

## The Solution

Plugger is an open-source Go CLI that manages PCE extensions as Docker containers. It handles the operational boilerplate so each plugin can focus on its function:

- Install plugins from a registry, a local file, a URL, or a container image
- Three scheduling modes: daemon (continuous), cron (periodic), event (webhook-triggered)
- Auto-restart with exponential backoff; HTTP health checks
- Unified web dashboard at `http://localhost:8800` — all plugin UIs proxied under one port
- PCE credentials injected at runtime; never baked into images
- Plugin scaffolding in Go, Python, Shell, or JavaScript

## How It Works

```
Step 1: Build
  git clone https://github.com/illumio-community/illumio-plugger && make build

Step 2: Initialize
  plugger init          # creates ~/.plugger/config.yaml with PCE connection

Step 3: Install and run
  plugger install ai-security-report
  plugger run           # starts all installed plugins; dashboard at :8800
```

## Selected Use Cases

**Incident Response Automation**
CrowdStrike detects a compromise. SOAR calls the Workload Isolator webhook. Illumio flips the workload into selective enforcement. Lateral movement is blocked in seconds, before the analyst finishes reading the alert.

**Audit Readiness**
Run ai-security-report for a scored posture summary mapped to NIST CSF and PCI-DSS controls. Run policy-resolver to produce concrete IP-level firewall rules from your label-based policy. Export both before an audit engagement.

**Change Impact Analysis**
Before a maintenance window or infrastructure change, run app-dependency-intel to see which applications depend on the target service, what the blast radius looks like, and whether any compliance boundaries are crossed.

**Multi-Team Policy Governance**
Use policy-gitops to store rulesets as YAML in Git. Changes go through pull requests with traffic evidence gates — a rule only provisions if observed traffic supports it. Security team reviews, network team reviews, audit trail is automatic.

**VEN Fleet Operations**
Use ven-fleet-manager to see which VENs are candidates for enforcement progression, which are on outdated versions, and which have compatibility issues before a PCE upgrade. Replaces ad hoc API queries with a persistent fleet dashboard.

## Building Custom Plugins

```bash
plugger create -t python my-plugin   # scaffold a Python plugin
plugger create -t go my-plugin       # scaffold a Go plugin with Illumio SDK
```

Plugins are standard Docker containers with a `plugin.yaml` manifest. Publish to any registry.json URL — teams install with `plugger install <name>`.
