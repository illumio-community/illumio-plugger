## Stale Workloads

**Type:** Daemon (24/7) | **Language:** Python (Illumio SDK) | **UI:** Yes

Discovers workloads that are offline, haven't sent a heartbeat, have no traffic, or are unmanaged.

**Install:**

## Palo Alto DAG Sync

**Type:** Daemon (24/7) | **Language:** Python (Illumio SDK) | **UI:** Yes

Syncs Illumio workload labels to Palo Alto Networks Dynamic Address Groups via the PAN-OS XML User-ID API. Enables label-based firewall policy automation.

**Install:**
```bash
# With Palo Alto configured
plugger install palo-alto-dag-sync \
  -e PALO_HOST=panorama.example.com \
  -e PALO_API_KEY=your-pan-api-key

# Dry-run mode (no Palo — shows what would sync)
plugger install palo-alto-dag-sync
```

**Config:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PALO_HOST` | | Panorama or firewall hostname |
| `PALO_API_KEY` | | PAN-OS API key |

**How it works:**
1. Polls PCE for all online workloads with labels
2. Builds PAN-OS tags from labels (e.g., `illumio-role-web`, `illumio-app-ordering`)
3. Registers IP-to-tag mappings via PAN-OS XML User-ID API
4. Palo Alto DAGs dynamically include workloads matching those tags
5. Dashboard shows tag distribution, sync history, and full tag registry

**Tag format examples:**
- `illumio-role-web` (52 IPs)
- `illumio-app-ordering` (32 IPs)
- `illumio-env-prod` (134 IPs)
- `illumio-loc-ca` (64 IPs)

**Dry-run mode:** Without `PALO_HOST`, the plugin runs against the PCE and shows what tags would be created and how many IPs would be registered — useful for validating the mapping before connecting a firewall.

- **Compliance Boundaries** — cross-zone traffic violations (PCI, SOX, HIPAA)
- **Change Impact** — what-if simulation for policy/label changes
- **Resiliency Scoring** — per-app 0-100 score on redundancy and SPOF exposure
- **Dependency Graph** — D3.js force-directed visualization with drill-down
